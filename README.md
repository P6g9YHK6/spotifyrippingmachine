# spotifyrippingmachine
an overlycomplicated mess of script to export data and songs from spotify using spotdl ‚ù§

Also makes .m3u automaticaly for navidrome autoimport

It is really unpolished atm but did the job to free myself from spotify and migrate in a painless fashion to foss softwares

also it it capable of auto exporting the weekly discovery playlist on a regular basis.
